Suit Riot

This is the official git repository of Suit Riot. You can see the latest master version in action at http://www.suitriot.com

Suit Riot is a web app written in Ruby on Rails, designed to allow users to share, view, and vote on images of men's wear. It began as a weekend project when I was learning RoR, and has been provided to the open source world both as a way of improving the original web site and as a tool to further refine my RoR coding technique.
