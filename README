Suit Riot

You can see a basic implementation of this code at http://www.suitriot.com

Suit Riot is a web app written in Ruby on Rails, designed to allow users to share, view, and vote on images of men's wear. It began as a weekend project when I was learning Ruby on Rails. Nowadays it's just a sample app to show some of my early work.
